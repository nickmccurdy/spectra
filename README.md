Spectra is a deployed music hosting system. It sits on your server or NAS, with access to your music files, and allows
easy transparent access to data and metadata. 

Spectra is built around a set of core ideas:
  - APIs should be clean, and RESTful.
  - Music formats shouldn't matter, because it's just data.
  - Decoding should be done at the most powerful location: the client
  - Deployable anywhere, from a laptop to a large-scale NAS
